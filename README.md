sudokode.net
============
Possibly the source code for the Web app/site running at http://sudokode.net.

Point
=====
I just started a new job doing web app development, which I've never really been super into. So I'm finally gonna use my domain to set up some sort of website using some modern web dev tools. Right now, I'm just playing around.

Requirements
============
Or at least the versions of them I'm currently using:
- python 3.5
- flask 0.10.1

Goals
=====
1. Make an actual website.
2. Learn about modern web development.
3. Goof off as much as possible.
